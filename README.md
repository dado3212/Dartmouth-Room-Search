# Dartmouth Room Search

### The Problem
There wasn't any way to easily view rooms on campus at Dartmouth.  You had to look through all of the building floorplans to find a room that suited you.

### The Solution
I went through all of the plans, extracted the room information, and made an easy way to view and sort the resulting data.  The site is live at http://dartmouthroomsearch.com.  You can see the creation process at my blog, http://blog.alexbeals.com/category/dartmouth-room-search.
